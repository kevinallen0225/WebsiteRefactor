# WebsiteRefact

A quick private snippet of some of the HTML/CSS that I contributed to during the ongoing refactoring of the St.Joseph's University IT Services Webpage. I have attached a recording of the webpage when functioning as intended however, The HTML file in the repo alone will not give you the webpage in its entirety. Because of the environment we have been developing in, img links can be shortened and certain areas of the site were only made once and used generically so when translated to a standalone HTML webpage it does not look as nice.
